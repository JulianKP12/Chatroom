# Chatroom

Just a little quick demo of using sockets to create a simple chatroom


### Installation:

just clone the client.exe file and run it, that's all there is to it!
The connection.py and server.py files aren't necessary to run the exe


### Bugs:

There's a whole lot of bugs with this version and it'll be really easy to break the chatbox,
i know, and atm i genually do not care enough to fix them as this is just a demo i created


### Antivirus:

Your antivirus will probably flag this as a virus, it's not tho
If you want confirmation, contact me on discord Kip#5909 and i'll let you read
the full code and recompile a new version for you in front of your eyes

# Chatroom

Just a little quick demo of using sockets to create a simple chatroom


### Installation:

for using it as a regular user, you only need to download the cient.py file and edit the 
ip of the room you want to connect in (should probs make that easier?). If you want
to host your own server, download all the files and just run the server.py file and
set up port forwarding if you want other people outside of your local network to connect


### Bugs:

There's a whole lot of bugs with this version and it'll be really easy to break the chatbox,
i know, and atm i genually do not care enough to fix them as this is just a demo i created
